Somebody broke into Kentucky's voter registration system last week but the officials are only saying that they patched it instead of saying who it was. Can you find a new way into their management system and identify the attacker? After registration closes, the site will be taken offline so don't miss your chance.

Note: This challenge uses a slightly nonstandard flag format
